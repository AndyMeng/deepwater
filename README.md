# Deep Water

### What it is
* Native implementation of Deep Learning models for GPU-optimized backends (mxnet, Caffe, TensorFlow, etc.)
* State-of-the-art Deep Learning models trained from the H2O Platform
* The next best thing after sliced bread
* Under development

### What it is not
* An oil drilling platform
